The most common way of versioning an API is to specify to the api version on the url.

curl https://api.ontrackretail.com/v2/addressbook/contacts

Other way is to specify the version on a HTTP Header. We could use a standard HTTP header for this and not a custom header as it might be filtered by some proxies or cdn.
The "norm", is to use the accept header for this purpose.

curl https://api.ontrackretail.com/addressbook/contacts \
 -H "Accept: application/vnd.ontrackretail.v2.json"

 With the version in the url, it is easier to test the different versions as we just need to change the version on the url.
 This might be confusing as the url should be semantically meaningful. The url should represent the resource. With the version on the url are we requesting
 the same resource but with a different meaning? Or we just have different representations of the same resource?
 We can use versioning in the url if we are changing the meaning of the resource.

 Using an HTTP header makes it harder to test, as every time we need to construct the request and configure the header.
But the url will be stable and will have a single location for the resource
