The most common way of versioning an API is to specify to the api version on the url.

curl https://api.ontrackretail.com/v2/addressbook/contacts -I

Other way is to specify the version on a HTTP Header. We should use a standard HTTP header for this and not a custom header as it might be filter by proxies or cdn.
Normally, the accept header is the one used for this purpose.

curl https://api.ontrackretail.com/addressbook/contacts -I \
 -H "Accept: application/vnd.ontrackretail.v2"

 With the version in the url, it is easir to test the different versions as we just need to change the version on the url.
 This might be confusing as the url should be semantically meaningfull. With the version on the url are we requesting a
 different version of the same resource? ie, do we have in our domain two versions of the same resource?
